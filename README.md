# TrafQ
TrafQ is a visual framework based on Open AI Gym environments and baseline algorithms for Traffic Light control optimization with Reinforcement Learning. Environments simulate real world road networks and traffic.

## Project goals
- A collection of RL environments for traffic light control of real road network, in the format of [Open AI Gym environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/)
- A set of baseline algorithms to run on the network environments in the style of [Open AI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines/) 
- A webapp dashboard to provide an interface for training, testing and visualizing RL agents on road networks

### Dashboard
Main features of the dashboard are:
1) Listing and loading Open AI Gym road network environments
2) Visualizing current simulation 
3) Listing and loading RL algorithms
